Amortization
Definition: The term “amortization” refers to two situations.
First, amortization is used in the process of paying off debt through regular principal and interest payments over time.

Amortization is important because it allows businesses and individuals to spread out large costs over time, providing a clear understanding of how much of a loan payment goes towards principal versus interest.

The main components of amortization are:
>Period
  This is the amount of time set aside for the debtor to pay the loan/mortgage
  For example if M takes a $100000 loan and is supposed to repay it in 3 years
  In this case 3 years is the period, which is mostly converted into months by multiplying by 12

>Principal
  This is the amount of money borrowed by the debtor
  For example if K borrows $40000 to build his dream house,
  In this case the $40000 is the principal

>Interest
  This is the percentage that the bank or financial institution makes for offering out the loan

Calculations

Monthly interest payment:
-Each month as the debtor makes regular payments, a portion of it is set aside to pay the interest then the remaining goes to pay the existing loan.
The formula to calculate this is ;
    =(interest * loan balance)/12 

Monthly principal payment:
-As we had stated that the principal is the total amount of loan offered, as premiums are paid, the portion thet remains after paying the interest,
goes to the premium payment.
Formula : 
   =total monthly premiums - monthly interest payments.
